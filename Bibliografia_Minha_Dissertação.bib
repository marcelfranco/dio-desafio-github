  Abstract                 = {A new pressure formulation for splitting methods is developed that results in high-order time-accurate schemes for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries.},

A single time scale, multiple space scale asymptotic analysis is used to gain insight into the limit behavior of the compressible flow equations as the Mach number vanishes. Motivated by these results, multiple pressure variables (MPV) are introduced into the numerical framework. These account separately for thermodynamic effects, acoustic wave propagation and the balance of forces. Discretized analogues of the averaging and large scale differencing procedures known from multiple scales asymptotics allow accurate capturing of various physical phenomena that are operative on very different length scales. The MPV approach combines the explicit numerical computation of global compression from the boundary and the long wavelength acoustics on coarse grids with an implicit pressure or pressure correction equation that formally converges to the corresponding incompressible one when the Mach number tends to zero.},

The method is based on the pressure-correction concept implemented on a semi-staggered grid. The computational procedure can handle cells of arbitrary shape, although solutions presented herein have been obtained only with meshes of triangular and quadrilateral cells. The discretization of the momentum equations is effected on dual cells surrounding the vertices of primary cells, while the pressure-correction equation applies to the primary-cell centroids and represents the conservation of mass across the primary cells. A special interpolation scheme s used to suppress pressure and velocity oscillations in cases where the semi-staggered arrangement does not ensure a sufficiently strong coupling between pressure and velocity to avoid such oscillations. Computational results presented for several viscous flows are shown to be in good agreement with analytical and experimental data reported in the open literature.},

ABSTRACT = { In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient approach for mobile activity recognition system (ARS) to detect human activities. The proposed energy-efficient ARS, using low sampling rates, can achieve high recognition accuracy and low energy consumption. A novel classifier that integrates hierarchical support vector machine and context-based classification (HSVMCC) is presented to achieve a high accuracy of activity recognition when the sampling rate is less than the activity frequency, i.e., the Nyquist sampling theorem is not satisfied. We tested the proposed energy-efficient approach with the data collected from 20 volunteers (14 males and six females) and the average recognition accuracy of around 96.0% was achieved. Results show that using a low sampling rate of 1Hz can save 17.3% and 59.6% of energy compared with the sampling rates of 5 Hz and 50 Hz. The proposed low sampling rate approach can greatly reduce the power consumption while maintaining high activity recognition accuracy. The composition of power consumption in online ARS is also investigated in this paper.},
